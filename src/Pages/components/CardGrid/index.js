    'backText' : "Pengfei was a class of 2022 McMaster Chemical Engineering graduate specializing in Water & Sustainable energy. When I was young, I always had a passion for helping people. Helping random grannies cross the road on the street, mowing neighborâ€™s grass, and giving a hand to friends on homework, you name it. During my university life, I constantly thought about how I can help on campus and what value can I bring to my peers. Ideas flew around, actions never arrived. After graduation, my partner and I saw a solution to helping student individuals, clubs, and organizations with customized clothing apparel. Without hesitation, Spark Printing was born. Spark Printing aims to empower students, clubs, and organizations by building high-quality, affordable, and custom apparel services and sets an example to encourage students to start their businesses with their little spark. A little Spark can set the prairie ablaze.",

    'role': 'Co-founder, COO',
    'backText' : "Leo was a class of 2021 graduate from the Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour program at McMaster University. During my undergraduate career, I was very fortunate to be involved in student life activities as a residence don, welcome week representative, and teaching assistant. Along the way, I met many incredible student leaders and worked with student organizations that had brilliant ideas and missions. I saw many eager student groups wanting to build identities and grow through branded merchandise. However, there lacked accessible and affordable custom apparel providers in the GTA area, especially for students. After working in the SaaS industry for over a year, I wanted to go back to my roots and build Spark Printing to bridge the gap. I hope that with us, student groups can unlock their true growth potential.",
